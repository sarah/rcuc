This is a simple bash script that I set up to automatically create a project structure for a non-Rails project using Cucumber and RSpec. 
It's nothing fancy, but I wanted to automate the process for myself. Note you have to have the proper gems installed -- it doesn't check for them, so if you don't have them, it'll error out. 

Simply put it where you keep your bash scripts -- mine is in ~/bin -- and run it with the name of the project you want to create as an argument: 

e.g. If you want to create a Tic Tac Toe project and you downloaded this dir into your ~/bin, run this:

$ ~/bin/rcuc/rcuc tic_tac_toe

That's sort of verbose, though, so you may as well make an alias to it.

That will generate the following directory structure with the proper wiring up of files: 

tic_tac_toe
  features
  --step_definitions
  --support
  ----env.rb
  lib
  --tic_tac_toe.rb
  spec
  --spec_helper.rb
  --tic_tac_toe_spec.rb

It also generates a dummy spec and a dummy feature that you can run, then remove. 

After creating it, run the dummy spec and feature just like you would normally: 

$ cd tic_tac_toe
$ cucumber features
$ spec specs/

Assuming you have the proper gems installed, you should see the output for passing tests.  At this point, you're set up.
